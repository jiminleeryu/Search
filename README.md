# Search
A search engine program employing an indexer and a querier is designed to efficiently retrieve and present relevant information from a vast dataset in response to user queries. The indexer processes and organizes the data, while the querier handles user queries and retrieves results from the indexed data. 

The indexer is responsible for analyzing the content of documents, breaking them down into smaller units (like words or phrases), and creating an index that maps these units to the documents in which they appear. This process involves techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words to ensure that queries can be matched accurately and quickly. The indexer then stores this index in a structured manner, optimizing retrieval speed.

The querier is the user-facing component that accepts search queries and interprets them. When a user enters a query, the querier parses it, identifies keywords, and searches the index for documents containing those keywords. The querier then ranks the results based on relevance, considering factors like term frequency and document importance. It presents the user with a list of documents that best match their query, often displaying snippets or summaries to provide context.

The indexer and querier together enable the search engine to offer rapid, accurate, and relevant search results. The indexer optimizes data storage and retrieval, while the querier enhances user experience by transforming queries into actionable information. This combination allows users to quickly find what they're looking for, making the search engine a powerful tool for information discovery across various domains, from the web to specialized databases.
